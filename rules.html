            <h2>ℹ️ About ActiPoints</h2>
            <p>
                Apart from technical knowledge and skills, to be successful as professionals, students should have excellent
                <strong>soft skills, leadership qualities, and team spirit</strong>. They should also possess
                <strong>entrepreneurial capabilities and societal commitment</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To nurture these qualities, <strong>KTU has introduced Activity Points</strong> that students must earn during their academic
                stay at the university. These cover <strong>extra-curricular and co-curricular activities</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>📌 <strong>B.Tech students</strong> must earn <strong>100 activity points</strong> to qualify for their degree.</li>
                <li>📌 <strong>Lateral entry students</strong> (joining from the 3rd semester) need <strong>75 points</strong>.</li>
                <li>📌 The points are awarded on a <strong>pass/fail basis</strong> and carry <strong>2 credits</strong>, but do not affect CGPA.</li>
                <li>📌 NSS & NCC points can be entered <strong>only after completing a 2-year program</strong>.</li>
                <li>📌 The portal is open for a <strong>specific time period</strong> for points submission.</li>
                <li>📌 All documental proof for awarding activity points must be maintained by the college authorities for verification.</li>
            </ul>
